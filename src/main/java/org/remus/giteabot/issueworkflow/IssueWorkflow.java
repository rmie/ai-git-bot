/**
 * Strategy contract for one pluggable workflow that runs when a bot is
 * assigned to an issue ({@link #onIssueAssigned}) and when it receives
 * follow-up comments on that issue ({@link #onIssueComment}). This is the
 * issue-side counterpart of {@code org.remus.giteabot.prworkflow.PrWorkflow}
 * and replaces the deprecated {@code Bot.botType} (CODING/WRITER) dispatch.
 *
 * <p>Implementations are registered automatically through Spring DI and
 * discovered by {@link IssueWorkflowRegistry}. The two built-in
 * compatibility workflows are {@code issue-coding} (delegates to
 * {@code IssueImplementationService}) and {@code issue-writer} (delegates to
 * {@code WriterAgentService}). Which workflow(s) run for a bot is resolved
 * from the bot's issue-assigned {@code WorkflowConfiguration} (kind
 * {@code ISSUE}) by {@link IssueWorkflowOrchestrator} — never from a
 * hardcoded bot category.</p>
 *
 * <p>Comment handling is part of the contract from day one: both events
 * belong to the same flow lifecycle, so implementations must consciously
 * decide their follow-up behavior instead of inheriting a silent no-op.</p>
